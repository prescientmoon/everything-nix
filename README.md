# Welcome to _the Satellite_

In case you are not familiar with nix/nixos, this is a collection of configuration files which build all my systems in a declarative manner. The tool used to configure the global system is called [nixos](https://nixos.org/), and the one used to configure the individual users is called [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

> A [visual history](./docs/history.md) of my setup is in the works!

## Features this repository includes:

- Sets up all the apps I use — including git, neovim, fish, tmux, starship, hyprland, anyrun, discord, zathura, foot & much more.
- Sets up my entire homelab — including zfs-based [impermanence](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings), automatic let's-encrypt certificates, tailscale, syncthing, vaultwarden, whoogle, pounce, calico, smos, intray, actual & more.
- Consistent base16 theming using [stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix)
- Declarative secret management using [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix)

The current state of this repo is a refactor of my old, messy nixos config, based on the structure of [this template](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs).

## Hosts

This repo's structure is based on separating configuration into individual hosts - different machines configured by me. Each host is named after things in space/mythology (_they are the same picture_). The hosts I have right now are:

- [calypso](./hosts/nixos/calypso/) — my personal laptop
- [tethys](./hosts/nixos/tethys/) — my previous personal laptop
- [lapetus](./hosts/nixos/lapetus/) — older laptop running as a server
- enceladus — my android phone. Although not configured using nix, this name gets referenced in some places

## Hall of fame

This section contains links to things which used to be in the previous section but are not used anymore. This section was created in June 2023, hence stuff I dropped earlier might not be here. Moreover, this list is sorted with the most recently dropped things at the top, as a sort of reverse-timeline.

- [htop](https://htop.dev/) — I switched to [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom), as the interface felt way cleaner
- [Wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) — I switched to [Foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot), as wezterm was laggy, unstable, and kept breaking between releases
- [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) — I switched to [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)
- [firenvim](https://glacambre/firenvim) - the concept is cool, but I found the whole thing pretty annoying at times
- [venn.nvim](https://jbyuki/venn.nvim) — the concept is cool, but I would use it about once a year
- [hydra.nvim](https://anuvyklack/hydra.nvim) — I was rarely using it, and it was taking up precious config space
- [winbar.nvim](https://github.com/fgheng/winbar.nvim) — I mostly had this here for the looks, so I moved the path it provided to my statusbar
- [treesitter-visual-context.nvim](https://github.com/haringsrob/nvim_context_vt) — felt like this was cluttering my screen more than anything
- [Paperplanes.nvim](https://rktjmp/paperplanes.nvim) — replaced by a single curl call
- [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) - experimented with eww for a bit, but setup was painful and bars are a bit useless
- [Neogit](https://github.com/NeogitOrg/neogit) — was a bit slow / clunky, so I switched to [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
- [Slambda](https://github.com/prescientmoon/slambda) — custom keyboard chording utility. I retired the project in favour of [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata)
- [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) + [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) — I switched to [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/)
- [Agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix) & [homeage](https://github.com/jordanisaacs/homeage) — I switched to [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix)
- [Mind.nvim](https://github.com/phaazon/mind.nvim) — self management tree editor. The project got archived, so I switched to [Smos](https://github.com/NorfairKing/smos).
- [Null-ls](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim) — general purpose neovim LSP. The project got archived, so I switched to [formatter.nvim](https://github.com/mhartington/formatter.nvim).
- [Wofi](https://sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/) — program launcher. I switched to [Anyrun](https://github.com/Kirottu/anyrun).
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) — terminal emulator. I switched to [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/).

  - [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) — desktop bar
  - [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) — program launcher. I switched to [Wofi](https://sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/).
  - [Spectacle](https://apps.kde.org/spectacle/) — screenshot tool. I switched to [Grimblast](https://github.com/hyprwm/contrib/tree/main/grimblast).
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) — web browser. I switched to `firefox` because it offers a better HM module.
