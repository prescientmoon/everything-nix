# Welcome to _the Satellite_

In case you are not familiar with nix/nixos, this is a collection of configuration files which build all my systems in a declarative manner. The tool used to configure the global system is called [nixos](https://nixos.org/), and the one used to configure the individual users is called [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

> A [visual history](./docs/history.md) of my setup is in the works!

## Features this repository includes:

- Sets up all the apps I use — including git, neovim, fish, tmux, starship, hyprland, anyrun, discord, zathura, foot & much more.
- Sets up my entire homelab — including zfs-based [impermanence](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings), automatic let's-encrypt certificates, tailscale, syncthing, vaultwarden, whoogle, pounce, calico, smos, intray, actual & more.
- Consistent base16 theming using [stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix)
- Declarative secret management using [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix)

The current state of this repo is a refactor of my old, messy nixos config, based on the structure of [this template](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs).

## Hosts

This repo's structure is based on the concept of hosts - individual machines configured by me. I'm naming each host based on things in space/mythology (_they are the same picture_). The hosts I have right now are:

- [tethys](./hosts/nixos/tethys/) — my personal laptop
- [lapetus](./hosts/nixos/lapetus/) — older laptop running as a server
- [euporie](./hosts/nixos/euporie/) — barebones host for testing things insdie a VM
- enceladus — my android phone. Although not configured using nix, this name gets referenced in some places

## Hall of fame

Includes links to stuff which used to be in the previous section but is not used anymore. Only created this section in June 2023, so stuff I used earlier might not be here. Sorted with the most recently dropped things at the top.

- [Wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) — I switched to [Foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot), as wezterm was laggy, unstable, and kept breaking between releases
- [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) — I switched to [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)
- [firenvim](https://glacambre/firenvim) - the concept is cool, but I found the whole thing pretty annoying at times
- [venn.nvim](https://jbyuki/venn.nvim) — the concept is cool, but I would use it about once a year
- [hydra.nvim](https://anuvyklack/hydra.nvim) — I was rarely using it, and it was taking up precious config space
- [winbar.nvim](https://github.com/fgheng/winbar.nvim) — I mostly had this here for the looks, so I moved the path it provided to my statusbar
- [treesitter-visual-context.nvim](https://github.com/haringsrob/nvim_context_vt) — felt like this was cluttering my screen more than anything
- [Paperplanes.nvim](https://rktjmp/paperplanes.nvim) — replaced by a single curl call
- [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) - experimented with eww for a bit, but setup was painful and bars are a bit useless
- [Neogit](https://github.com/NeogitOrg/neogit) — was a bit slow / clunky, so I switched to [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
- [Slambda](https://github.com/prescientmoon/slambda) — custom keyboard chording utility. I retired the project in favour of [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata)

- [Null-ls](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim) — general purpose neovim LSP. The project got archived, so I switched to [formatter.nvim](https://github.com/mhartington/formatter.nvim).
- [Wofi](https://sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/) — program launcher. I switched to [Anyrun](https://github.com/Kirottu/anyrun).

  - [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) — desktop bar
  - [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) — program launcher. I switched to [Wofi](https://sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/).

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) — web browser. I switched to `firefox` because it offers a better HM module.
